## **Spatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**

1. **Network Mapping**: 
   - Analyzed street patterns and assessed street forms, identifying key factors like street straightness and proximity that influence surface temperature.
   - Utilized Python’s multi-processing techniques to optimize performance in large-scale network analysis.
  
2. **Agent-Based Modeling**: 
   - Developed models for traffic flow.
   - Created flood simulations to assess evacuation strategies during floods.
  
3. **Climate Mapping**: 
   - Mapped Land Surface Temperature (LST) and improved the scaling of multiple observation maps.
   - Mapped air pollution to identify environmental risks.
  
4. **Urban & Spatial Mapping**: 
   - Applied NDVI, NDBI, and land cover classification to assess land use and environmental health.
   - Predicted land use patterns using deep learning and machine learning techniques.
   - Conducted natural hazard mapping to evaluate risks and assist in disaster preparedness.

## **Data Science**

1. **Machine Learning & Forecasting**: 
   - Built and applied time series models to improve forecasting accuracy.
   - Enhanced regression time series prediction using Holt-Winters’ multiplicative smoothing.
   - Improved ARIMA time series predictions by incorporating external variables.

2. **Big Data Management**: 
   - Managed and predicted outcomes using small datasets with numerous columns and limited rows.
   - Preprocessed, cleaned, and handled large datasets, ensuring data integrity for analysis.
   - Identified and analyzed interconnections across diverse data types.
   - Developed optimal strategies for forecasting large datasets with numerous columns and limited rows, addressing real-world challenges like missing data and inconsistencies.
