## **🌍 Spatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**

1. **🗺️ Network Mapping**  
   - Analyzed street patterns and assessed street forms, identifying key factors like street straightness and proximity that influence surface temperature.  
   - Leveraged Python’s multi-processing techniques to optimize performance in large-scale network analysis.
  
2. **🚗 Agent-Based Modeling**  
   - Developed models for traffic flow and created flood simulations to assess evacuation strategies during floods.
  
3. **🌡️ Climate Mapping**  
   - Mapped Land Surface Temperature (LST) and improved the scaling of multiple observation maps.  
   - Mapped air pollution to identify environmental risks and support urban planning.

4. **🏙️ Urban & Spatial Mapping**  
   - Applied NDVI, NDBI, and land cover classification to assess land use and environmental health.  
   - Predicted land use patterns using deep learning and machine learning techniques.  
   - Conducted natural hazard mapping to evaluate risks and improve disaster preparedness.

## **📊 Data Science**

1. **🤖 Machine Learning & Forecasting**  
   - Built and applied time series models to improve forecasting accuracy.  
   - Enhanced regression time series predictions using Holt-Winters’ multiplicative smoothing.  
   - Improved ARIMA time series predictions by incorporating external variables.

2. **💾 Big Data Management**  
   - Managed and predicted outcomes using small datasets with numerous columns and limited rows.  
   - Preprocessed, cleaned, and handled large datasets, ensuring data integrity for in-depth analysis.  
   - Identified and analyzed interconnections across diverse data types.  
   - Developed strategies for forecasting large datasets with many columns and limited rows, addressing challenges like missing data and inconsistencies.
