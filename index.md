#Urban Spatial Planner & analyzer | Urban Data Scientist
As an urban planner, my interests lie in urban sustainable development, particularly in:
1) Spatial development explains patterns of human behavior through mathematics and geometry, so I enjoy solving problems through spatial analysis.
2) Due to data's importance for addressing challenges, I became a data scientist.
