![LST from 2013 to 2021 (Mashhad)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/173180442-6d1f4537-8b47-4a04-b46d-029930684e73.png)
##### The map depicts the mean land surface temperature (LST) of Mashhad city, Iran, from 2013 to 2021. The data source is a Landsat-8 TOA (Top-of-Atmosphere) image collection processed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) at a 100-meter scale.

![NDVI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176388635-6a30bb8e-c91f-45d3-9c1b-a7e8c31d2e53.png)
##### All NDVI values fell within the same range, from -0.5 to 0.7. Typically, areas with low NDVI values represent built-up areas and bare soil, while vegetated areas have moderate values.  According to the boxplot, districts 6 (c) and 10 (d) exhibited the highest median NDVI, while districts 11 (e) and 1 (b) had lower median NDVI values.

#### Visualizing Temperature's Data using Altair Python library 
#### Land Surface Temperature (LST)

##### The data was collected and exported from Google Earth Engine (GEE) before being visualized using the Altair Python library. Interestingly, the maximum temperature between 2020 and 2021, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, was lower than in previous years.

#### Air Temperature

##### The data was gathered from free air data source and was visualized using Altair Python library. For more informations please visit : https://www.meteoblue.com/ 

#### LST, NDVI, and Housing Price Distributions across 22 Tehran Districts
![LST, NDVI, and Housing Price Distributions across 22 Tehran Districts](https://github.com/kimiachenari/images/blob/main/Untitled-1.jpg)
##### This plot visualizes the distribution rank across 22 Tehran districts for three variables: Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Housing Price.

## Network Analyse using Python and AnyLogic

#### Network Closeness using Momepy Python library
![Closenessn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176389458-251bece2-051e-4f2e-8ecd-7369699eb506.png)
#### Closeness centrality is a concept in graph theory that measures a node's average distance to all other nodes in the network. In this context, nodes likely represent street intersections, and edges represent connecting streets. A higher closeness centrality value indicates that an intersection is, on average, closer to other intersections.

#### Network Edge Bearing using OSMnx Python library

![edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176389728-714e7d7e-649b-4c74-b297-cec7ea989e6a.png)
#### Street edge bearing was used to classify urban patterns in Mashhad. This chart visualizes the distribution of street orientations across all districts in the city.

#### Network indexes

#### This figure depicts network indices calculated using SpaceSyntax for the Sareban neighborhood in Bojnourd city, Iran.

#### AnyLogic

![Screenshot 2024-07-02 090042](https://github.com/kimiachenari/kimiachenari.github.io/assets/104256716/5bdb818e-9ab2-4be9-914b-0684982767c0)

During my undergraduate studies, I created a basic model of traffic lights' cotrol and operating traffic flow in a street using AnyLogic: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AB_y-NpQ4RkZrg37bEdhMbL1L51FP2vX/view?usp=sharing

## spatial analyse using Image processing 
#### NDVI Distribution (OpenCV Python library)
![ndvi dis2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176740202-0e4ab348-8a85-488e-b115-3c2ab1257c41.png)

The distribution of vegetation in a city cannot be reliably calculated solely based on the black and white range of an image.  While darker areas in a black and white image might suggest more vegetation, other factors like soil type and shadows can influence the image.

#### Shade distribution (OpenCV Python library)

![final3](https://github.com/kimiachenari/kimiachenari.github.io/assets/104256716/750f74d9-428b-4716-a044-84c02527f4cf)
The distribution of shade and bright colors in Yazd's vernacular architecture is surprising. This is because these traditional buildings are designed to create distributed shade, resulting in a relatively even balance of shade and sunlight throughout neighborhoods.

#### Covid-19
![176381924-6818dc57-2997-4746-9522-5fc832b3831d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176382083-f54f431e-3c75-4725-b7b1-50a1d8cdd458.png)

##### This map depicts the spread of the COVID-19 virus across Iran. It likely originated in Qom province before reaching the capital city, Tehran. The map was created using geospatial libraries GeoPandas and Matplotlib.


## Spatial Analyse using Software 
#### Site Analysis

![site analysis3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104256716/176394727-40da3f75-2e0e-40f8-880e-8444600e3e0e.png)
#### This figure analyzes various urban design indexes for the Sareban neighborhood in Bojnourd city, Iran. ArcGIS was likely used for spatial analysis, while SketchUp and Photoshop are better suited for 3D modeling and image editing, respectively.
#### Site Selection using ArcGIS
