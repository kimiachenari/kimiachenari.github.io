## 🔧 Skills
## **Spatial Analysis & Remote Sensing**

1. **Network Mapping**: 
   - Analyzed street patterns and assessed street forms, identifying key factors like street straightness and proximity that influence surface temperature.
   - Utilized Python’s multi-processing techniques to optimize performance in large-scale network analysis.
  
2. **Agent-Based Modeling**: 
   - Developed models for traffic flow.
   - Created flood simulations to assess evacuation strategies during floods.
  
3. **Climate Mapping**: 
   - Mapped Land Surface Temperature (LST) and improved the scaling of multiple observation maps.
   - Mapped air pollution to identify environmental risks.
  
4. **Urban & Spatial Mapping**: 
   - Applied NDVI, NDBI, and land cover classification to assess land use and environmental health.
   - Predicted land use patterns using deep learning and machine learning techniques.
   - Conducted natural hazard mapping to evaluate risks and assist in disaster preparedness.
